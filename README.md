# HTML Iframe Lab

## Problem Statement

The `iframe` element displays an entire HTML file inside itself, allowing one
HTML page to be contained within another. Before JavaScript became widely used,
_anytime_ a website user clicked on a link, the entire page would refresh. The
`iframe` tag is used to reload specific parts of a page without changing others,
providing a better user experience. For example, when a navigation link was
clicked, the navigation would not refresh: only the iframe portion of a page
would reload.

With JavaScript, HTML content can be added and removed programmatically without
needing a refresh. This replaced the need for the `iframe` tag in many websites.

Still, there are some specific uses where iframes can be very valuable. One
example: embedded maps.   Embedded maps are a simple option for websites that
need a custom map and they're frequently used in contact pages for businesses. An `iframe` is used to contain the
entire, interactive, map page within our own websites. Using an `iframe`, we do not need to write our own JavaScript.

In this lab, we will practice what we've learned about HTML iframes. To do this, we will be creating
an embedded map similar to those we see on business websites.

## Objectives

1. Create an embedded Google map from scratch
2. Better understand what we've learned about HTML iframes and their attributes

## Setting Up the Map

Before we can get to writing HTML, we need to get a map to embed within an
iframe.

In your browser, head to
[https://www.google.com/maps](https://www.google.com/maps) and search for a
general location. For instance, `11 Broadway, Manhattan, NY`.

Now, click the menu icon located at the top left of the screen and select
**Share or embed map**. Then click the **Embed map** tab.

Google provides the entire iframe tag, but we will add some additional
attributes manually. Highlight the iframe embed code and copy it to your
clipboard. In `index.html` paste the code snippet.

## Reinforce Our Understanding of Iframes

We've already got a basic `iframe` from Google. To pass all the tests, we'll need to add
the following attributes:

* Add a `width` attribute set to "100%"
* Add a `height` attribute set to "400px"
* Change the `frameborder` attribute to "1"

Run `learn` to test your work and `learn submit` once you've passed all the
tests.

## Conclusion

The `iframe` element allows us to load another HTML page inside our own HTML
page. It is like looking through a window from _our_ page into another page
displaying a Google Map.

While many uses of `iframe` tags were replaced with JavaScript, they still
prove valuable in specific cases.
